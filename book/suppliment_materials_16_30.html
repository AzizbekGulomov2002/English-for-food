                        Bread baking consists of a series of steps including mixing, fermentation,
                        makeup, proofing, baking, cooling, slicing and packaging. Due to their
                        critical role, these processes must be carefully operated to meet pre-set
                        conditions and specifications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The baking process is the process by which finished bread, cookies, and
                        biscuits are obtained. This process involves temperature, moisture, and
                        volume changes, and all of these aspects are combined. In the past, the
                        evolution of the variables was monitored and adjusted empirically. Primary packaging touches
                        your product. Secondary may house individual
                        product packages—think a plastic pill bottle in a paperboard carton—or it
                        may bundle together the primary packaging into a multi pack. Tertiary
                        packaging is key for storage and shipping.
                        The bags are usually loaded into a hopper at the top of the machine. The
                        hopper feeds the bags into a sealing mechanism, where the bags are sealed
                        shut. The sealed bags are then cut open and the product is loaded into the
                        bag. The bag is then closed and the product is ready to be packaged.

                        FOOD RECYCLING METHODS
                    </p> <br>
                    Food waste recycling can take many forms, from composting to biogas
                    production. Composting improves soil quality and fertility, while
                    anaerobic digestion processes produce renewable energy. So, it
                    becomes a way to save resources, give back to the environment, and be
                    more self-sustainable
                    “Food recycling” refers to inedible food disposal methods like animal
                    feeding, anaerobic digestion, and composting. Food recycling options
                    include animal feeding, industrial uses, and composting.
