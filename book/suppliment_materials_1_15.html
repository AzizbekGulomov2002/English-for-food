                        The principles of juice processing include proper post harvest handling (e.g.
                        transport, sorting and chilling), food safety, processing and packaging
                        procedures, quality control and so on. Processing of a fresh product to extract its
                        juice involves more than just squeezing it into a container. The aim is also to
                        increase shelflife, improve or retain taste, color and quality and to add value to
                        an agricultural product that might not be suitable to be marketed as a fresh
                        product.

                        Throughout the manufacturing process, sugar is tested for purity, sucrose
                        content, proper pH balance, temperature, color and consistency. Monitoring of
                        equipment and filtering materials ensures that they are working efficiently.
                        Because it’s 99.9% sucrose, refined sugar is one of the highest-quality products

                        Cheese manufacturing
                    </p> <br>
                    Cheese is a fermented food product in which the sugar in milk (lactose) is
                    converted to lactic acid by the action of bacteria. Fundamental to cheese
                    manufacture is the removal of moisture from milk through its conversion to a gel
                    followed by contraction of the gel in a process known as syneresis. The milk for
                    some cheeses is gelled by acidification but most the milk for most varieties is
                    coagulated by the enzymes in preparations known as rennets. The gel is cut or
                    broken and the gel pieces contract expressing as whey much of the liquid that
                    was trapped inside. The solid material which will become cheese is known as
                    curd and at this stage of manufacture is suspended in the whey. Syneresis is
                    encouraged by acidification and is often facilitated by heating (“cooking”,
                    “scalding”) the curds/whey mixture. Eventually, the curds are separated from the
                    whey; whey is an important and valuable by-product of cheese manufacture

                    <p>Flour milling is a complex process of separating the endosperm from the
                        bran and germ of the wheat kernel and then grinding the endosperm into
                        flour, which is sifted to obtain flours of different qualities.
                        Wheat is cleaned before milling, and according to the different characteristics
                        of the impurities, the corresponding cleaning equipment (such as plane rotary
                        screen, stone remover, magnetic separator) is utilized to remove various
                        impurities. Then the wheat is moisture adjusted, which is favorable to the later
                        peeling as well as crushing.
                        Next, the wheat is fed into the milling system, and after a series of grinding by
                        the hulling mill, dregs mill and core mill, and separation of pure flour grains,
                        bran-containing flour grains and bran flakes by the clearing system, the final
                        flour that meets the standard is extracted and sent for packaging.</p>
