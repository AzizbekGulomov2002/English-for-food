                    <p>Food is a vital <strong>component</strong> of our lives. The food industry is the basic need
                        for
                        every country. It was developed by Egyptians and Greeks millions of years ago.
                        <strong>Milling</strong> and <strong>baking</strong> were in practice, <strong>olive
                            oil</strong> and honey were commonly exchanged. <strong>Cheese</strong> and
                        <strong>butter</strong> were also historic food.
                    </p>

                    <p>People started to grow food as an industry when the chemical technology emerged. Sugar
                        manufacture, cane sugar, beet sugar, <strong>fermentation</strong>, wine making, beer
                        brewing,
                        bread baking, manufacture of vinegar and <strong>essential oils</strong> were the products
                        of
                        early food technology. Today the food industry covers diverse activities including food
                        supply,
                        production, <strong>harvesting</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>,
                        <strong>packaging</strong>, transportation, <strong>distribution</strong>,
                        <strong>consumption</strong>, and <strong>disposal</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Food is defined as anything that can be regarded as food, whether it comes from a natural
                        source
                        of meat, eggs, milk, or apple; an integrally processed product like <strong>flour</strong>
                        and
                        cooked meals for example cakes. But, scientifically speaking, food is not as much a
                        substance
                        that we eat as a substance that provides certain <strong>nutrients</strong> when we eat.
                        Therefore, nutritionists use the term "<strong>stuffs</strong>" to refer to these parts of
                        food
                        that a person may eat, in particular <strong>proteins</strong>, fats and
                        <strong>carbohydrates</strong>. A person must have enough knowledge of the composition,
                        properties and use of food by human body in order to be a very competent food technology
                        engineer or food technologist.
                    </p>

                    <p>The food industry is a branch of the national economy that produces food products. The
                        network
                        includes meat and milk, oil and fish products, flour and <strong>cereals</strong>, pasta,
                        canned
                        fruit and vegetables, milk and oil, sugar, tea packaging, <strong>confectionery</strong>,
                        bread,
                        <strong>grapes</strong> and champagne, alcohol, vodka, tobacco, beer, thirst-quenching
                        drinks,

                    Question " Did ancient people cultivate harvest as a food source? <br>
                    The Past Simple is used:
                    To express completed action in the past
                    Example: People started to grow food millions of years ago.
                    To describe a series of completed actions in the past
                    Example: The farmer harvested all sugar canes and took them to the juice
                    extraction process.
                    To express habits in the past
                    Example: To be a professional nutritionist, Karim studied lots of books about
                    food properties.

                    1. Scientists consider that growing food was established first in Middle East
                    approximately ten or eleven thousand years ago. It was because the area was
                    rich to edible and easily cultivated crops like wheat and barley and lentils, peas
                    and other vegetables. Later on technology has an immense impact on food
                    production. The development of plow capable of breaking the dense, wet soils
                    came to Europe by the 18th century.
                    2. Wild grains were harvested and eaten about 105,000 years ago. Some oldest
                    crops include emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter
                    vetch, chickpeas and flax. 6200 years ago, Chinese people cultivated rice and
                    soya beans.
