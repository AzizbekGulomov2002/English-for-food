                        IV. Reading task.
                        Read the passage for overall understanding paying attention to the bolded words.
                        Microscopes for food analysis are used to find out what's in the food we eat.
                        They can help identify things like additives, harmful substances, and even tiny
                        bits of things like glass or metal.
                        Microscopy methods are useful for studying food and for checking how it is
                        packaged. Quality control teams can use microscopes to check for rust, leaks,
                        and to study the layers of films.
                        The ability to test different plastic layers and see how they hold up in
                        different environments is really important for making sure food stays fresh
                        and safe. SEM analysis tells us important things about how the packaging
                        looks really close up and about tiny particles that might affect its properties.
                        New improvements in thermal microscopy for checking food quality now
                        microscopy
                        make it possible to analyze a wider range of things, especially starch grains.
                        Thermal microscopy helps food scientists understand how to keep starch
                        grains from breaking in various conditions.
                        Bacteria can be seen using a special microscope and colored stains.
                        Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, E. coli Coli, Shigella, and Campylobacter
                        are some bacteria that scientists often study and look at using gram staining.

                        <br>Verb + Preposition + Noun: A verb combined with a preposition and a
                        microscopy
                        noun, forming a phrase indicating an action and its object.
                        Example: "look at the stars," "talk about politics," "listen to music."
                        <br>Verb + Gerund: A verb followed by a gerund (the "-ing" form of a verb),
                        indicating an ongoing or habitual action.
                        Example: "enjoy swimming," "avoid eating," "consider traveling."

                    ANSWER`S KEY
                    I. Pre reading task.
                    1. Microscopy is the study of objects using a microscope. It is divided into
                    many types optical microscope, electron microscope, multiphoton
                    microscope, X ray microscope, laser X ray microscope and is designed to
                    observe and record radiographic images. sample size.
                    2. The creation of the electron microscope and the development of new
                    methods for studying microorganisms made it possible to study them at the
                    molecular level, providing a deeper understanding of the properties of
                    bacteria, their chemical activity and their control. control microbiological
                    processes. Technical microbiology includes microorganisms in food
                    production, studies methods of food production using microorganisms in
                    wine, beer, bread, wine, fermented milk products, cheese, pickled
                    vegetables, etc. Microbiology in food production also studies the unwanted
                    activities of foreign microorganisms. It helps prevent the growth of
                    microorganisms and obtain high quality products. <br>

                    V. Reading comprehension.
                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    <br>1. Microscopy could be a commonly utilized procedure in nourishment
                    industry primarily since it permits examination at tall amplification of
                    nourishment materials cereals, meat, creams, refreshments, natural
                    products, vegetables, dairy items, etc.
                    <br>2. Thermal microscopy is a sort of filtering test microscopy that maps the
                    neighborhood temperature and warm conductivity of an interface. The test
                    in a checking warm magnifying instrument is touchy to neighborhood
                    temperatures giving a nano scale thermometer. Warm estimations at the
                    nanometer scale are of both logical and mechanical intrigued. <br>
                    3. Foods are perishable or deteriorative by nature. Based on the mode of
                    action, major food preservation techniques can be categorized as: slowing
                    down or inhibiting chemical deterioration and microbial growth; directly
                    inactivating bacteria, yeast, molds and enzymes and avoiding recontamination
                    before and after processing.

                    I can speak about the text I listened to. <br>
                    DO YOU KNOW? <br>
                    According to an ancient Chinese text, the
                    Chinese viewed magnified specimens by lens
                    at the end of a tube, which tube was filled
                    with varying levels of water according to
                    the degree of magnification they wished to
                    achieve. Ingenious, effective and repeatable
                    in the home, today. That this occurred
                    some 4,000 years ago in the Chow
                    -Foo dynasty and more than 3,500 years
                    before the "father of modern microscopy"
                    was born is quite remarkable. <br>
