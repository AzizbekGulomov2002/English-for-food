                        Macronutrients, are needed in large quantities by our bodies to provide
                        energy and prevent disease. Macronutrients are the three basic nutrients that
                        contain in our food: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Carbohydrates give
                        your body quick energy. They exist in foods such as bread, pasta and fruit.
                        They come in three diverse forms monosaccharides, disaccharides and
                        oligosaccharides. However, it is the glucose that propagates sugar that forms
                        other saccharides and is the energy substrate for the regulation of red blood
                        cells, white blood cells, renal medulla, brain and peripheral nerves. Protein
                        gives our body important building blocks called amino acids that are needed
                        for muscles, skin, blood, and the brain and nerves. Foods that are high in
                        protein include animal foods such as meat and eggs. Protein is also found in
                        beans, nuts, soybeans, legumes, and quinoa.
                        Contrary to what most people think, your body needs fat to work well. It
                        gives you energy, helps your body use vitamins, and keeps your organs safe.
                        However, some fats are better than others. Saturated and trans fats can be
                        macronutrients
                        bad for you, but unsaturated fats are good for you. All that can be found in
                        foods like nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil is healthy fats.
                        V. Reading comprehension. <br>
                        Answer the questions based on the passage. <br>
                        1. What are the macronutrients and how important they are?
                        2. Which food items are rich for carbohydrates?
                        3. What are functions of fats in the body? <br>

                    Example: Meat and eggs are rich for protein.
                    All that rich for protein are meat and eggs. <br>
                    1. Foods that are high in protein include animal foods.
                    2. Fat gives you energy, helps your body use vitamins, and keeps your organs
                    safe. <br>
                    3. Protein is found in beans, nuts, soybeans, legumes, and quinoa.
                    <br>4. Amino acids are needed for muscles, skin, blood, and the brain and nerves.
                    <br>5. Macronutrients are the three basic nutrients that contain in our food:
                    carbohydrates, proteins and fats.

                        I. Pre reading task.</b> <br>
                    1. When you learn about nutrition, you can look at lots of different things.
                    Everywhere you look, it seems like someone is promoting a new nutrient that
                    is supposed to make a big difference to your health. In simple words, the diet
                    focuses on three main types of nutrients that most people know: protein, fat,
                    and carbohydrates. Eating the right amounts of these important nutrients is
                    an easy way to make sure you are getting enough nutrition to keep your
                    body and mind fueled and energized for your daily activities.
                    <br>2. Although crop production has grown, the amount of nutrients in some
                    crops has gone down. This has led to people questioning if intensive farming
                    is a good idea. Is it possible that using a lot of artificial pesticides, fertilizers,
                    and other chemicals is making the soil and crops unhealthy and causing the
                    food we eat to be less nutritious. Our research shows that it's not because the
                    macronutrients
                    soil doesn't have enough nutrients. Plants can only absorb nutrients that are
                    available to them. These nutrients are not changed by intensive farming
                    methods.

                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    <br>1. Macronutrients, are needed in large quantities by our bodies to provide
                    energy and prevent disease. Macronutrients are the three basic nutrients that
                    contain in our food: carbohydrates, proteins and fats.
                    <br>2. Carbohydrates give your body quick energy. They exist in foods such as
                    bread, pasta and fruit. <br>
                    3. Contrary to what most people think, your body needs fat to work well. It
                    gives you energy, helps your body use vitamins, and keeps your organs safe.
                    However, some fats are better than others. Saturated and trans fats can be
                    bad for you, but unsaturated fats are good for you. All that can be found in
                    foods like nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil is healthy fats. <br>
