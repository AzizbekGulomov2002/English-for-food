                        Read the passage for overall understanding paying attention to the bolded words.
                        Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. The human body needs less
                        micronutrients than macronutrients. The former mean “small nutrients”
                        whereas the latter is “big nutrients”. The human body does not produce these
                        essential substances for life, but absorbs them only through nutrition.
                        Vitamins are organic compounds produced by plants and animals that can
                        be broken down by heat, acid, or air. Minerals, on the other hand, are
                        inorganic substances that exist in soil or water and cannot be broken down.
                        When you eat, you consume vitamins made by plants and animals or minerals
                        absorbed by them. Each food contains different micronutrients, so it's best to
                        eat a variety of foods to ensure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals.
                        micronutrients
                        Vitamins and minerals are essential for growth, immune function, brain
                        development, and many other important functions.
                        The next element necessary for life is water. It is as essential as other
                        nutrients for delivering oxygen throughout the body, preventing kidney
                        disease, and other body functions. Most foods contain water, even when they
                        appear solid and dry. The body can get about 20 percent of its total water
                        needs from solid foods alone. A small amount of water is produced as a
                        necessary product for the process of digesting food. Water obtained in this way
                        provides about 10 percent of the body's water needs. The remaining 70% or
                        more of water required by the body must come from the intake of various
                        forms of fluids. <br>
                        <b>V. Reading comprehension.</b> <br>
                        Answer the questions based on the passage.
                        1. Why are micronutrients essential?
                        2. Explain how human body absorbs vitamins and minerals.
                        3. Talk about the importance of water for healthy diet. <br>
                        <b>VI. Grammar.</b> Comparing and contrasting.
                        We can use these expressions in order to compare and contrast two things:
                        X is as …as Y
                        - Water is as essential as other nutrients.
                        …whereas,
                        - The micronutrients mean “small nutrients” whereas, macronutrients are
                        “big nutrients”.
                        …on the other hand…
                        - Minerals, on the other hand, are inorganic substances that exist in soil or
                        water and cannot be broken down. <br>
                        <b>VII. Grammar revision.</b> Exercise 1. Merge the sentences using the structures to
                        compare and contrast. Sometimes two or more ways can be possible.
                        micronutrients
                        Example: Organic compounds are produced by plants and animals.
                        Inorganic substances that exist in soil or water.
                        Organic compounds are produced by plants and animals whereas inorganic
                        ones exist in soil or water. <br>
                        1. Water intake is essential. Other nutrients too.
                        <br>2. Vitamins and minerals are essential for growth, immune function, brain
                        development. Water is responsible for delivering oxygen in body.
                        <br>3. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. Macronutrients are
                        carbohydrates, proteins and fats.
                        <br>4. Only 10 % of water is produced by human body. Remaining 70 % should
                        come from drinking water or liquids.
                        <br>5. Water is essential element. Other micronutrients are vital too.
                        <br>6. Inorganic substances cannot be broken down. Organic compounds can be
                        broken down by heat, acid, or air.
                        VIII. Classroom activity. “Descriptive” method.
                        Show the image 2 to the students and ask them to talk about micronutrients
                        containing in different food items. Encourage them use comparing and
                        contrasting expressions.
                        Example: Oranges are rich for Vitamin C, whereas carrots are source of
