                        Grain is an important product of agricultural production, the basis of
                        human nutrition and fodder base for the development of productive animal
                        husbandry. Grain contains a large amount of dry matter compared to other
                        agricultural products, which makes up 85% of the mass of mature grain. These
                        are mainly high-value proteins and digestible carbohydrates.
                        Grain can be stored for several years under normal conditions and
                        transported over long distances. Depending on the purpose of use, the grains
                        are divided into those used for weighing flour, intended for semolina, used in
                        technology and seeds. Grain storage in grain-growing areas is carried out in
                        grain receiving facilities with mechanized warehouses, as well as in large-
                        capacity elevators in grain consumption and processing areas.
                        These establishments are equipped with freezers and active ventilation
                        devices. Active biological processes called the post-harvest ripening process take
                        place in the grain brought to the warehouses after harvesting. The duration of
                        this process is from 2-3 days to 10-16 days, depending on the type and variety
                        of grain plant, its storage conditions. <br>

                            Grain growing is the 1. ________process by which grains like wheat, rice,
                        corn, and barley are cultivated for various purposes, including food,
                        animal feed, and industrial uses. The grain growing process involves
                        several stages, from planting to 2_______, and requires careful attention to
                        factors such as soil quality, climate, and agricultural practices.
                        The first step in 3_______ growing is land preparation. Farmers plow and
                        cultivate the soil to create a suitable seedbed for planting. Soil testing may
                        be conducted to assess its nutrient content and pH levels, ensuring optimal
                        conditions for seed germination and plant growth. <br>
                        After 4________ the seeds germinate and develop into seedlings.
                        Throughout the growing season, farmers monitor the crops for signs of
                        pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies. They may apply fertilizers,
                        herbicides, and pesticides as needed to 5______healthy growth and protect
                        the plants from damage.
                        As the grain plants mature, they enter the reproductive stage, where
                        flowers develop and pollination occurs. Depending on the type of grain,
                        6_______ may be carried out by wind, insects, or self-pollination.
                        Once the grains are fully developed, they are ready for 7_______.
                        Harvesting methods vary depending on the type of grain and local
                        agricultural practices. Common harvesting 8_______include using combine
                        harvesters for large-scale operations or hand harvesting for smaller farms. <br>

                    1.The main crops grown are cotton, wheat, barley, rice, corn, potatoes,
                    fruits, and vegetables. Most of the grain in the country is grown in the
                    south, in places like Kashkadarya, Samarkand, Jizzakh, Ferghana,
                    Tashkent and Surkhandarya.
                    2. Grain is the seeds of certain types of grass like wheat, oats, rice, and
                    corn that are collected after they have grown. Other important grains are
                    sorghum, millet, rye, and barley. Grains, also known as cereals, are the
                    most important food all over the world. People get about half of their
                    energy from grains.

                        Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    1. Eating whole grains often is part of a healthy diet and can help lower the
                    chance of heart problems. Eating whole grains with fiber in your diet every
                    day can help keep your stomach healthy. Also, eating foods like brown rice
                    and whole wheat bread can help you manage your weight.
                    2. The milling process often involves taking off the tough outer hull. The
                    grains can be heated, soaked, or cooked to make them soft and release
                    their starch and other carbohydrates. Breaking, crushing, or grinding the
                    grains to make the product we want.
                    3. After the crops are picked, dried, separated, and packed, they are taken
                    to the warehouse to be kept. The warehouse is where your farm produce
                    stays before it is sold or used. <br>
