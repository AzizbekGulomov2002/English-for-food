                        Processing grain into cereal involves several steps to transform raw grains
                        like wheat, corn, oats, or rice into the familiar breakfast foods enjoyed by
                        many. The process typically begins with cleaning the grains to remove
                        impurities such as dirt, stones, and foreign matter.
                        Once cleaned, the grains are often conditioned by soaking or steaming to
                        soften the outer bran layer, making it easier to remove during milling.
                        Milling is the next step, where the grains are ground into flour. This can be
                        achieved using various methods, including stone milling or roller milling,
                        which separates the bran and germ from the endosperm to produce
                        different types of flour.
                        The flour may undergo further processing, such as fortification with
                        vitamins and minerals to enhance its nutritional value. It can also be mixed
                        with water, yeast, and other ingredients to make dough for bread, or it can
                        be cooked, extruded, and dried to produce breakfast cereals like flakes,
                        puffs, or granola.
                        Finally, the processed cereal products are packaged and distributed to
                        consumers. From the farm to the breakfast table, the journey of grain into
                        cereal involves careful processing and production to create nutritious and
                        delicious foods enjoyed by people of all ages. <br>

                            Cereal processing is a crucial step in the production of various grain-
                        based products that are staples in 1__________around the world. From
                        wheat and rice to oats and corn, cereals are processed to create a wide array
                        of foods, including bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, and 2____________.
                        The first stage of cereal processing involves cleaning and sorting the raw
                        grains to remove any 3_____________such as dirt, stones, or foreign seeds.
                        Once cleaned, the grains are often conditioned by soaking or steaming to
                        soften the outer 4___________layer, making it easier to remove during
                        milling.Cereal processing also includes techniques such as cooking, extrusion and
                        drying, which are used to create a wide rangeof
                        5__________________products.
                        Cooking grains such as rice or oats softens them and makes easier to
                        6______________,while extrusion is is used to produce breakfast cereal,
                        snacks and pet foods by forcing a mixture of grains and other ingredients
                        through a machine that shapes and cooks them simultaniously.
                        In conclusion, cereal processing plays a vital role in transforming raw
                        grains into a diverse range of 7_____________and delicious foods. By
                        cleaning, milling, and further processing grains, manufacturers can
                        produce a variety of products that contribute to 8___________and
                        satisfying diets worldwide.

                    1.The main thing we do is grind the grain to make it easier to cook and
                    turn into tasty food. Cereals are usually not eaten without cooking them
                    first. They can be ground up in different ways, either with a dry or wet
                    method, depending on the type of cereal and how people like to eat them.

                    2. Improving Nutrition: Processing methods can make cereals healthier by
                    making the nutrients easier for the body to use, getting rid of things that
                    can stop the body from using nutrients, and making the nutrient levels in
                    cereals better. <br>

                        Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    1. Grains have lots of important nutrients like complex carbs, fiber, B
                    vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate), and minerals (iron,
                    magnesium, and selenium).
                    2. The milling process often involves taking off the tough outer hull. The
                    grains can be heated, soaked, or cooked to make them soft and release
                    their starch and other carbohydrates. Breaking, crushing, or grinding the
                    grains to make the product we want.
                    3. After the crops are picked, dried, separated, and packed, they are taken
                    to the warehouse to be kept. The warehouse is where your farm produce
                    stays before it is sold or used. <br>
