                        Flour is a product obtained by or grinding grain. During the grinding process,
                        the bran is separated from the grain and the endosperm is crushed to the
                        required extent. Flour is divided into wheat flour, rye flour, barley flour, oat
                        flour, corn flour, rice flour and other types, depending on the type of grain.
                        Flour is a raw material for a number of sectors of the food industry, primarily
                        for the bakery, confectionery and pasta industry. The main types of flour are
                        wheat and rye flour. About 90% of the total produced flour corresponds to
                        wheat flour. According to its properties, flour is divided into bread flour and
                        pasta flour. The type of flour is determined by the amount obtained from 100
                        kg of grain, i.e. output. The higher the yield, the lower the quality of the flour.
                        High, first and second grades of flour are obtained from wheat grain. Flour
                        milling refers to a set of technological processes of processing grain into flour,
                        which must satisfy the standard requirements of flour and have high
                        consumption properties. <br>

                        -As a result, …
                        As a result, the bran is separated from the grain.
                        -This means that, …

                        Mineral substances of flour
                        Flour consists of organic and mineral substances. When flour is heated at
                        high temperatures, 1_________ matter burns and turns into gas. Ash, which
                        consists of mineral substances, remains as a 2____________. That's why
                        literature and documents often use the words "ash content", "ash elements" or
                        "ash content" instead of the word "amount of 3____________ substances". Its
                        mineral substances mainly consist of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium,
                        calcium and 4__________. Other elements (copper, manganese, zinc, etc.) are
                        found in very small quantities.
                        Mineral substances are mainly located in the 5___________layers of the
                        grain. The higher the quality of the flour, the less minerals it contains. In
                        other words, the lower the grade of flour, the higher its 6_________ content.
                        That's why ashiness is its main quality indicator. Vitamins are located in the
                        outer layers of the grain and in the 7________. Therefore, the amount of
                        vitamins in it is very low. It mainly contains vitamins of group B (B1, B2, B3,
                        B6), and vitamin E. Vitamins A, D and C are not found in grain at all.

                    grain growing technology
                    I. Pre reading task.
                    1.People a long time ago used to make flour by grinding grains with simple
                    stone tools. This was way back in the old days, during the Neolithic era.
                    As time went on, the way people ground grain changed. They started using
                    quern stones, which are two stones that you grind grain between using
                    your hands. This became the usual way of grinding grain.
                    2. Flour helps to hold together and give shape to baked foods. When you
                    mix wheat flour with water, the proteins in the flour join together to make
                    gluten. This stretchy gluten structure holds the gases that make the dough
                    rise. The amount of protein in flour affects how strong the dough will be.
