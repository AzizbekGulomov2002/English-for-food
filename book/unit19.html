                    1.A good way to tell if your pasta is good is by feeling its texture. It should
                    not look shiny or feel smooth. Pasta should go well with meats and sauces.
                    Pasta with a rough texture seems to work better with these ingredients
                    than smooth pasta.
                    . Pasta comes in different qualities. The way it cooks, like how much it
                    breaks apart and how long it takes to cook, can be affected by how it is
                    made and the ingredients used.The making process has several steps and
                    three important factors. The things that affect how well something is made
                    are the materials used, having skilled workers, and the technology used in
                    making it. The pasta is made from mixing Semolina and water together.3. Pasta is a type of food made
                    from grain, which is an important part of a
                    healthy diet. Other healthy foods include vegetables, fruits, fish, and
                    poultry. It gives you energy and has fiber if it's made from whole grain. It
                    can help with tummy problems and might lower cholesterol. <br>

                    The term "pasta" itself comes from the Italian word for the dough used to
                    make paste shapes. These names usually come from how they were made
                    or what they look like. For example, "spaghetti" comes from the Italian
                    word "spago," which means string, reflecting its long, thin shape. On the
                    other hand, "ravioli" comes from the Italian word "riavvolgere," meaning
                    "to wrap," describing the process of wrapping dough around the filling
                    before cutting it into squares.
                    "Orecchiette," which translates to "little ears," likely refers to its shape ear-
                    like shape. They're mean "pasta bianca" or "white pasta" because they're
