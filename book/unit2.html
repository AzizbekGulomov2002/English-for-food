                    Modern technologies of the food industry make a great contribution to
                    reducing the level of hunger on earth by creating fast and high-quality food
                    products. Agricultural and farming products are being automated with digital
                    and advanced technologies. Below are some of the most commonly used
                    technologies: <br>

                    Genetically modified organisms. By inserting them into plant genes, disease
                    resistance, fruit size increase, and crop production even in unfavorable
                    conditions are achieved. <br>
                    Drones are an incomparable assistant devices in monitoring organic crop
                    growth in cultivated fields and transmitting satellite images. They are also used
                    to deliver ready-made meals to busy locations. With sensors, restaurant owners
                    can monitor the entire journey to ensure that all safety standards are met. <br>
                    Owners of artificial intelligence are also present in the technology of the
                    meat industry. They are especially effective in poultry, helping to detect health
                    problems in birds through the sounds they make. These robots can also help
                    with egg collection in poultry farms. <br>

                    <b>Question:</b>  Are health problems of birds detected by artificial intelligence? <br>
                    - The passive is more formal than the active and it is more common in written
                    language. We often use the passive when we don’t know who is responsible for
                    the action:
                    Genetically modified organisms are inserted into plant genes. <br>
                    - We can use “by” to say who or what is responsible for the action:
                    Genetically modified organisms are inserted into plant genes by food scientists.

                    1. Modern technologies of the food industry make a great contribution to
                    reducing the level of hunger on earth by creating fast and high-quality food
                    products and GM (“genetically modified”) food is one of the most common
                    technology.
                    <br>2. By inserting genetically modified organisms into plant genes, disease resistance,
                    fruit size increase, and crop production even in unfavorable conditions can be
                    achieved.
                    <br>3. Drones are an incomparable assistant in monitoring crop growth in cultivated
                    fields and transmitting satellite images in the field of agriculture.
                    <br>4. Owners of artificial intelligence are also present in the technology of the meat
                    industry. They are especially effective in poultry, helping to detect health
                    problems in birds through the sounds they make. These robots can also help with
                    egg collection in poultry farms. <br> <br>
