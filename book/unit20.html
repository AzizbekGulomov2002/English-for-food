                        IV. Reading task. Read the passage for overall understanding paying attention to
                        the bolded words. <br>
                        Alcoholic drinks are drinks containing ethyl alcohol (alcohol).
                        Alcoholic beverages include alcohol, vodka, liqueur-vodka products, rum,
                        whiskey, and wines. Food ethyl alcohol is made from raw materials
                        containing starch or sugar. Rectified ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) is a colorless,
                        clear liquid without foreign tastes and odors.
                        Vodka is obtained by mixing rectified alcohol with softened water. A
                        small amount of invert sugar, soda and citric acid, sugar and skimmed
                        milk, etc. are added to vodka in order to soften and improve its taste.
                        Liqueurs are characterized by high aromatic properties and high sugar
                        content. Depending on the content of alcohol and the raw materials used,
                        liqueurs are divided into strong, dessert and cream types.
                        Rum is a strong alcoholic drink made from alcohol obtained by
                        fermenting sugarcane sugar and cane molasses. Rum is a light brown clear
                        solution with a unique smell, slightly burning taste, and contains 45%
                        alcohol and 2% sugar. <br>
                        Whiskey is a strong alcoholic drink with 45% alcohol content. Whiskey
                        made from grains (barley, corn or their mixture) is made by keeping alcohol
                        in charred barrels for 3-10 years.
                        Grape wine is made by ripening grapes. The alcohol content of grape
                        wines can be from 9% to 20%. depending on the color, grape wines are
                        divided into white, pink and red wines. Depending on the technology of
                        preparation, wines are divided into light, fortified, flavored, playful,
                        sparkling or carbonated types. <br>
                        Cognac is a high-strength alcoholic drink (it contains 40-57% alcohol),
                        which is made from brandy alcohol by distilling still wines. Cognac's golden
                        color and complex aroma are formed as a result of keeping cognac in oak
                        barrels for several years (not less than 3 years).

                        activity.
                        “Role playing” method. <br>
                        Ask two students to act as shop assistant and customer. Give some help for
                        language and vocabulary. Encourage them to make their dialogue as
                        informative and interesting as possible.
                        Example:
                        Teacher: Good morning, class. Today, we're going to discuss an important
                        topi c:the negative health effects of alcohol. Does anyone have any thoughts
                        or questions about this?
                        Student: Um, yeah, I've heard that drinking alcohol isn't good for you, but
                        I'm not sure exactly why.
                        Teacher: That's a great question. Let's talk about it. Alcohol can actually
                        harm several parts of your body, including your liver, brain, and heart. For
                        example, excessive drinking over time can lead to liver disease and even liver
                        failure.
                        alcohol bevarages
                        Student: Wow, I didn't know that. I thought only heavy drinkers had to
                        worry about liver problems.
                        Teacher: It's true that heavy drinking poses a higher risk, but even moderate
                        drinking can cause damage over time. Plus, alcohol can affect your brain,
                        impairing your judgment and coordination, which can lead to accidents or
                        injuries.
                        Student: So, it's not just about the long-term effects but also the immediate
                        risks?
                        Teacher: Exactly. And let's not forget about the impact on mental health.
                        Alcohol can worsen conditions like anxiety and depression, making them
                        harder to manage.
                        Student: That's really concerning. I never realized how serious the effects of
