                        Chocolate is a confectionery product obtained by mixing the products
                        obtained from the processing of cocoa beans (crushed cocoa and cocoa
                        butter) with sugar and is characterized by a dark brown, shiny surface,
                        pleasant taste and elegant aroma. Depending on the recipe and the method
                        of processing, chocolate is divided into simple, dessert, porous and spicy
                        chocolates. Nut, fruit and other various confectionery textures are used as
                        technology of chocolate progucts
                        ingredients in chocolate preparation. As a result, the particles of such
                        chocolate mass are very small, and the chocolate mass itself is elegant.
                        Plain, dessert and porous chocolates are prepared with or without
                        adding various tasty and aromatic substances. Dry milk, dry cream, roasted
                        nut kernels, coffee, waffles, cookies and the like are used as such additives in
                        the preparation of chocolate. Additive-free (original) chocolate is made from
                        crushed cocoa, cocoa butter and powdered sugar. The resulting product is
                        called original chocolate.
                        Chocolate is stored in dry, clean, ventilated rooms at a temperature of
                        18-3 degrees, with relative air humidity not exceeding 75%. If these
                        conditions are observed, the shelf life of chocolate without additives is 6
                        months, and that of chocolate with additives and ingredients is 3 months.

                        called Lindt Excellence Dark Chocolate with Sea Salt. Have you ever had
                        it?
                        Friend 2: Oh, hey, Mark! No, I haven't tried that one yet. But I love Lindt
                        chocolates. What's so special about this one?

                        Friend 1: Well, it's this perfect blend of rich dark chocolate with just a hint

                        Friend 2: That sounds incredible! I'm a sucker for dark chocolate, especially
                        when it has that balance of sweet and salty. Where did you get it?
                        Friend 1: I found it at this specialty chocolate shop downtown. They have
                        the most amazing selection of chocolates from all over the world. You

                        Friend 2: Absolutely! Thanks for the recommendation, Mark. I'll make sure
                        to pick up a bar next time I'm in the area. Do they have any other
                        interesting flavors?
                        Friend 1: Oh, definitely! They have everything from classic milk chocolate
                        to exotic flavors like chili-infused chocolate. It's a chocolate lover's paradise!
                        Friend 2: Wow, that sounds like my kind of place! Thanks again for telling
                        me about it. I can't wait to try that Lindt chocolate you mentioned.
                        Friend 1: No problem, Sarah! Let me know what you think when you try it.
                        I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
                        Friend 2: Will do, Mark! Thanks again for the chocolate chat. It's got me
                        craving some sweets now!
                        Friend 1: Anytime, Sarah! You know where to find me if you ever need a
