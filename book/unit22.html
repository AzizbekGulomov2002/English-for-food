                        Fats are a complex mixture of organic compounds with very similar
                        physico-chemical properties in the tissues of plants and living organisms.
                        They are distinguished from other substances by the following properties:
                        - insolubility in water (hydrophobicity) and solubility in organic solvents
                        (gasoline, chloroform, hexane, etc.); - the presence of high molecular fatty
                        acids, carbohydrate radicals and complex ether groups corresponding to
                        them. Such substances can have a great physiological effect on body

                        tissues.
                        Fats are one of the most important components of food products.
                        They are used in the production of various consumer products, and this is
                        one of the factors that determine the nutritional and biological value of
                        consumer products. In terms of energy value (caloric content), fats make
                        up 30-35% of a person's need for food products, that is, an average of
                        100-108 g per day, including direct fat-oil products as 50-52 g should be
                        consumed. Long-term non-consumption of fats, low consumption or
                        consumption of fats that contain few necessary biologically active
                        components leads to negative physiological changes in the body: central
                        nervous system dysfunction, decreased immunity and life may be

                    How Food Choices Impact Our Health
                    In today's fast-paced world, convenience often takes precedence over
                    nutrition, leading to a rise in consumer fat production. The foods we choose to
                    consume play a 1___role in the body's fat production and storage processes.
                    Understanding how our dietary choices impact fat production is essential for
                    making 2___ decisions about our 3____and well-being.
                    Consumer fat production refers to the body's synthesis and storage of fat
                    resulting from the consumption of food. The foods we eat provide the necessary
                    4_____and energy for bodily functions, but excessive intake of certain
                    ingredients, such as refined sugars and unhealthy fats, can lead to the
                    accumulation of excess body fat.
                    One of the 5_____culprits contributing to consumer fat production is the
                    consumption of highly processed foods. These 6_____ often contain high levels
                    of added sugars, refined carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats, which are quickly
                    7_____into the bloodstream, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels and
                    increased fat storage.
                    For example, sugary beverages like soda, energy drinks, and sweetened fruit
                    juices are notorious for their high sugar 8_____and empty calories. Consuming
                    these 9_______regularly can contribute to weight gain and visceral fat
                    accumulation, increasing the risk of obesity-related health conditions.Similarly, foods high in
                    unhealthy fats, such as fried foods, processed
                    10_____, and commercially baked goods, can contribute to consumer fat
                    production. These foods are often high in trans fats and saturated fats,
                    which can raise cholesterol levels and 11____fat storage, particularly
                    around the abdominal area.
                    In 12______, adopting a diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods can
                    support healthy fat metabolism and 13____ well-being. Whole foods, such
                    as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, provide
                    essential 14_____, fiber, and antioxidants that promote satiety and regulate
                    blood sugar levels.
                    Focusing on 15_____control and mindful eating is another
                    16_____aspect of managing consumer fat production. Paying 17_____to
                    hunger and18_____cues, eating slowly, and savoring each bite can help
                    prevent overeating and promote a healthy relationship with food.

                    I. Pre reading task.</b>
                    1.Fats in food can be saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated.
                    Eating too much fat, or the wrong kind of fat, is not good for your health.
                    Some foods with fat include butter, oil, nuts, meat, fish, and some dairy
                    products. A little bit of fat is important for a healthy diet. Fat is important
                    because it gives the body fatty acids that it needs but cannot make on its
                    own. Fat helps the body take in vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E.
                    These vitamins need fats to be absorbed into the body.
                    2. Fats in food are important to give your body energy and help cells work
                    properly. They also keep your organs safe and help to keep your body
                    warm. Fats help your body take in vitamins and make hormones. They are
                    made from glycerol and three fatty acids. They are good for your diet
                    description of fats
                    because they give you energy and provide important fatty acids and
                    vitamins that are found in fat. They also make you feel full, add taste, and
                    make food enjoyable to eat. <br>

                   <p>
                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    1.Fat is a type of body tissue in animals. It's a soft layer that holds energy
                    and keeps organs safe. Fat can also mean being chubby or thick, like a
                    chubby piglet or a wallet full of money. Some foods, like butter or
                    avocado, contain fat. Chocolate bars cooked in hot oil have a high amount
                    of fat.2.Saturated fats are usually hard at room temperature, don't go bad fast,
                    and have a high melting point. Unsaturated fats are usually liquid at room
                    temperature, go bad quickly, and melt easily. The fat in food or oils can be
                    studied by looking at its different parts, like fatty acids, glycerides,
                    phospholipids, sterols, pigments, and vitamins. <br>
