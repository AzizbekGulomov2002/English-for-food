                        the bolded words.
                        The process of cleaning oil from unwanted lipid groups and impurities
                        is called refining. The purpose of refining is to cleanly separate
                        triacylglycerols from other lipids and impurities from natural oils and fats.
                        But in all cases, refining is not carried out until all structural lipids and
                        impurities are lost. It depends on the purpose of the oil. But any oil must
                        first be completely cleaned of mechanical impurities and water. This
                        condition is fulfilled at the stage of primary purification of oil in oil-oil
                        production enterprises. Strainers, centrifuges, filter presses and other
                        devices are used to separate solid compounds and water from oil.
                        Due to the fact that lipids, which are part of natural oils and fats, have
                        different physical and chemical properties, modern refining is a complex
                        process consisting of a sequence of technological processes that differ in
                        the nature of physical and chemical effects on these lipids. The most basic
                        condition for applying any technological process in refining is to preserve
                        triacylglycerols in oils and fats in their native, i.e. natural form.
                        The modern technology of full refining envisages cleaning the oil from
                        phospholipids, wax and waxy substances, free fatty acids, coloring
                        substances. These processes are called hydration, crystallization,
                        neutralization, oil whitening, oil staining (deodorization) processes. Full
                        refinement is not always necessary. Salad oils used directly for food,
                        margarine, confectionery and culinary products, and oils and fats used in
                        the production of mayonnaise are fully refined. In other cases, for
                        example, in the production of saturated fats, extraction and deodorization
                        processes may not be performed.
                        At present, distillation refining without alkaline neutralization is
                        recommended for fats and oils with a low content of free fatty acids. At the
                        same time, free fatty acids and volatile substances that give taste and smell
                        are separated from the oil. <br>

                        EXTRACTION FROM CRUDE OIL</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Cooking oil is an essential ingredient in our daily culinary endeavors, adding
                    flavor, texture, and nutrition to our favorite dishes. But have you ever wondered
                    how this vital 1. ____is extracted from its primary 2._____, crude oil? Let's delve
                    into the fascinating process of cooking oil extraction from crude oil.
                    Crude oil, also known as 3._______, is a naturally occurring liquid found
                    beneath the Earth's surface. It's composed of various hydrocarbons and other
                    organic compounds. While crude oil is 4._______ known for its role in fuel
                    production, it also serves as a precursor for a wide range of products, including
                    cooking oil.
                    The process of extracting cooking oil from crude oil involves several stages,
                    each designed to separate the desired components from the raw material. Here's a
                    simplified overview of the extraction process:
                    Distillation: The first step in cooking oil extraction is 5.________. Crude oil is
                    heated in a distillation tower, where it undergoes fractional distillation. This
                    process separates the crude oil into different fractions based on their boiling
                    points. The lighter 6.______, such as gasoline and diesel, are extracted at the top
                    of the tower, while the heavier fractions, including those used for cooking oil, are
                    collected at the bottom.
                    Desalting: After distillation, the crude oil undergoes a desalting process to
                    remove any salt and 7.________. This step is crucial for maintaining the quality
                    and purity of the final cooking oil product. Desalting is typically achieved by
                    mixing the crude oil with water and then centrifuging it to separate the salt and
                    other contaminants.Degumming: Next, the crude oil is subjected to degumming to remove any
                    gums and phospholipids present in the oil. These impurities can affect the taste
                    and stability of the cooking oil. 8._______is often carried out by adding water to
                    the crude oil and then centrifuging it to separate the gums from the oil.
                    Neutralization: Following degumming, the crude oil undergoes
                    neutralization to remove any free fatty acids present in the oil. Free fatty acids
                    can 9_______ to off-flavors and reduce the shelf life of the cooking oil.
                    Bleaching: Once 10_______ is complete, the crude oil may undergo a
                    bleaching process to remove any pigments and other impurities that can affect
                    the color and appearance of the cooking oil. Bleaching agents, such as
                    11________ clay or activated carbon, are mixed with the oil to absorb the
                    unwanted substances, which are then filtered out.
                    Deodorization: The final step in cooking oil extraction is deodorization,
                    where the oil is heated under 12_______to remove any volatile compounds that
                    contribute to off-flavors and odors.
                    After undergoing these processes, the
                    crude oil is transformed into the cooking oil that we use in our kitchens every
                    day. It's important to note that the specific 13.______methods and refining steps
                    may vary depending on the type of cooking oil being produced and the desired
                    quality standards.

                    1.Making oil useful is an important process. It changes crude oil into
                    things we can use like fuel, oil for machines, and kerosene. The process of
                    making oil involves different steps like distilling, breaking down, treating,
                    and refining the products.One way to tell if your oil has been highly
                    refined is if it doesn't taste or smell like the original plant. Unrefined oils
                    are made without using heat or chemicals. Oils are taken out of the plant
                    parts (seeds or nuts) by pressing them.

                    2. Unrefined edible oil has lots of bad stuff in it, like gums, pigments,
                    waxes, phosphatides, and free fatty acids. Some of these things can make
                    us sick. Edible oil refinery is important to clean and improve the quality of
                    edible oil. The goal of the process is to make the oil better quality, look
                    clearer, smell better, last longer, be safer to eat, and not lose too much oil
                    during the process.

                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    Chemical refining takes out free fatty acids using caustic soda and then
                    separates the soap by spinning it in a machine. Physical refining removes
                    free fatty acids and other compounds by using steam to separate them.
                    This process is also called steam refining. The oil is heated and then
                    separated in a tall tower by temperature. The material is changed into
                    finished products like gasoline, diesel, asphalt, and solvents by using heat,
                    pressure, or a catalyst.2. The goal of these treatments is to improve the quality of the oil by
                    making it look clearer, smell better, have a lighter color, last longer, and be
                    safer to use. This is done by removing harmful substances and also trying to
                    prevent the oil from being wasted during the processing. Processed oil goes
                    through more steps than unprocessed oil. It usually makes a product that
                    lasts longer, doesn't produce as much smoke when heated, and has fewer
                    tiny pieces in it. Processed oils are usually better for cooking food in a lot of
                    oil at high temperatures because they can handle the heat better. <br>
