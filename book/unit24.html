                        nutritional value of meat
                        One of the main branches of the food industry in our republic is the
                        meat industry. It is known that meat and meat products are necessary and
                        important for every human body because they contain a large amount of
                        valuable proteins. Meat proteins are several times higher than vegetable
                        proteins, so they are an important source of energy.
                        Considering the main composition of the protein product, it consists of
                        a combination of different amino acids. Proteins are divided into complete
                        and incomplete proteins depending on the amount of amino acids. It is
                        known that an adult needs 105-150 g of protein per day. It has been
                        determined that quality meat contains an average of 20% protein. The
                        energy value (caloric content) of meat depends on its quality, fatness and
                        leanness of the animal, feeding method, nutrition, age, gender,
                        physiological state, etc., and it was tested to be approximately 1200-2800
                        kilocalories per kilogram.
                        Beef contains 72-75% water and 25-28% dry matter. But almost 60% of
                        the dry residue is protein, 5% is fat, and 1-1.2% are minerals, vitamins,
                        enzymes and hormones. 85% of the meat protein consists of amino acids
                        that are full value and irreplaceable. Nucleoproteins, which are considered
                        extremely complex, are also found in meat. These are ribonucleic and
                        deoxyribonucleic acids, elastin, collagen mucoproteins. Minerals
                        (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, even phosphorus and
                        copper) occupy a significant place in beef. It is known that the increase of
                        fatty substances in meat leads to the decrease of mineral substances in it.

                    informative and interesting as possible.
                    Example: <br>

                    Nutritionist: Hello! How are you today?
                    Client: I'm doing well, thank you. I've been thinking a lot about my diet lately,
                    and I wanted to get your opinion on something.
                    Nutritionist: Of course, I'm here to help. What's on your mind?
                    Client: Well, I've been considering reducing my meat consumption. I've heard a
                    lot about the health and environmental benefits of eating less meat, but
                    I'm not sure how to go about it.
                    Nutritionist: That's a great topic to discuss. Reducing meat intake can indeed
                    have numerous health benefits, such as lowering the risk of heart
                    disease and certain cancers. It can also have positive environmental
                    impacts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving water
                    and land resources.
                    Client: That's exactly what I've read. But I'm concerned about getting enough
                    protein in my diet if I cut back on meat. How can I ensure I'm still meeting
                    my nutritional needs?
                    Nutritionist: That's a valid concern, but there are plenty of plant-based sources of
                    protein that you can incorporate into your diet. Foods like beans,
                    lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all excellent
                    sources of protein. By including a variety of these foods in your
                    meals, you can easily meet your protein requirements.
                    Client: That sounds manageable. I also enjoy the taste of meat, so I'm worried
                    about missing out on that flavor.
                    Nutritionist: There are many plant-based meat alternatives available nowadays
                    that mimic the taste and texture of meat quite well. These products
                    can be used in place of meat in your favorite recipes, providing you
                    with a similar flavor experience without the negative health and
                    environmental impacts associated with conventional meat
                    consumption.
                    Client: That's reassuring to hear. I think I'm ready to start making some changes
                    to my diet. Thank you so much for your guidance!
                    Nutritionist: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. Remember, making
                    small, gradual changes to your diet is often the most sustainable
                    approach. If you have any more questions or need further assistance,
                    don't hesitate to reach out.
