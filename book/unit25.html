                        Milk is a very valuable food product. It is a dispersed medium (a
                        solution of plasma-mineral salts and milk sugar). It consists of a colloidal
                        phase (proteins and salts) and a small dispersed phase (milk fat). Milk
                        contains an average of 3.8% milk fat, 4.7% milk sugar, 3.3% protein, 0.7%
                        mineral substances and 87.5% water.
                        The milk and milk products industry has the main sectors such as the
                        production of milk and cheese products, butter and milk preserves. Dairy
                        products production network supplies the population with various
                        pasteurized and sterilized milk and cream, fermented milk products, butter,
                        cheese, ice cream. Currently, in many countries, new technological
                        processes, pasteurization of dairy products using infrared rays and high-
                        frequency electricity have been launched. The acidity of milk depends on
                        its salt, protein, carbohydrates, citric acid and others. Lactic acid
                        accumulates in milk as a result of fermentation of milk sugar under the
                        influence of milk bacteria. Freshness of milk is judged by its acidity.
                        Milk density is one of the main indicators of milk quality. It shows how
                        much milk mass is greater than water mass in the same volume. Milk
                        density depends on the amount of dry substances (fat, sugar, protein) in
                        milk. The boiling temperature of milk is slightly higher than that of water
                        - equal to 100.2 C. <br>

                    <br>Ask two students to act as friends lost a watch and trying to find it. Give some
                    help for language and vocabulary. Encourage them to make their dialogue as
                    informative and interesting as possible.
                    Example: <br>
                    Friend 1: Hey, Sarah! What's up? You look a bit worried.
                    Friend 2: Hi, Emily. Yeah, I am. I think I lost my watch.
                    Friend 1: Oh no! Where did you last see it?
                    Friend 2: I remember having it on my wrist when I was at
                    your place yesterday.
                    Friend 1: Hmm, let's think. Was it on the table when we
                    were studying?
                    Friend 2: I don't remember taking it off there. But it might
                    have slipped off when I was reaching for my bag on the
                    chair.
                    Friend 1: Okay, let's check there first. Maybe it fell between
                    the cushions or under the chair.
                    Friend 2: Good idea. If it's not there, I'll have to retrace my
                    steps from your place to mine.
                    Friend 1: Don't worry, we'll find it. Let's start by looking
                    around the chair carefully.
                    Friend 2: Yeah, let's hope it's just hiding somewhere. Thanks
                    for helping me, Emily.
                    Friend 1: Of course, Sarah. Friends help each other out,
                    especially in times like this. Let's find that watch!

                    C, and keeps its shape at a temperature of 10-25 C. Flavoring components
                    of butter include diacetyl, volatile fatty acids, some of their esters, proteins,
                    fats, and hydrochloric acid. Together, these substances give the butter a
                    pleasant taste and smell. <br>
                    Carotene is a natural coloring substance that gives yellow color to butter.
                    Depending on the amount of carotene, the butter will be yellow, yellowish
