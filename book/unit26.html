                        Salting of vegetables is aimed at forming lactic acid and other products
                        of fermentation in them.For pickling, pick cucumbers of the correct shape,
                        undamaged and, if possible, of the same size. If the cucumber is slightly
                        withered, it is put in cold water for 4-5 hours before salting. Pickled tomato
                        fruits are also sorted.
                        Before salting, cucumbers are separated according to their length:
                        technology of pickling vegetables
                        cucumbers up to 3-5 cm in 1st group, 5-7 cm in 2nd group, 7-9 cm in 3rd
                        group, and up to 12 cm in 4th group are separated and they are salted
                        separately. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spices and containers (glass jars, barrels,
                        etc.) are thoroughly washed. Water is prepared before salting them. For this,
                        6 kg of salt is dissolved in 100 liters of drinking water. A third of the
                        prepared seasoning is placed at the bottom of the dish, and then all the
                        seasoning is placed on top of the cucumber. At the end, salt water is put into
                        the container, so that the vegetables do not float on the surface, a clean cloth
                        is written on it, it is closed with a wooden lid and it is pressed with a load.
                        After 40-50 days, pickled cucumbers or tomatoes will be ready to eat.
                        The concentration of salt in the brine solution depends on the size of the
                        vegetables, their ripeness, and the storage conditions of the pickled
                        vegetables. If mold appears on the surface of pickled vegetables during
                        storage, it should be removed immediately. It is recommended to sprinkle a
                        little mustard powder on the vegetables so that mold does not appear on the
                        surface of the pickled vegetables. <br>
