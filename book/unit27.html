                        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Ins and Outs of Egg Farming</b></p>
                        Egg farming, also known as poultry farming, is a vital component of the
                        global food industry. It involves the production of eggs for consumption, both
                        in their raw form and as processed products. From the moment an egg is laid to
                        its journey onto our plates, egg farming encompasses various practices and
                        considerations, including sustainability efforts.
                        In traditional egg farming, hens are raised primarily for their egg-laying
                        capabilities. These hens are housed in specialized facilities known as chicken
                        coops or henhouses. Modern egg farming operations prioritize the welfare of

                        the hens, providing ample space, proper nutrition, and access to clean water and
                        fresh air.
                        One crucial aspect of egg farming is the management of egg
                        production cycles. This involves monitoring the health and well-being of the
                        hens, ensuring optimal conditions for egg laying, and implementing measures to
                        minimize stress factors that could affect productivity.
                        Sustainable egg farming practices also focus on environmental stewardship.
                        This includes efficient use of resources, such as water and feed, as well as waste
                        management strategies to minimize environmental impact. Some egg farms
                        utilize renewable energy sources, such as solar power, to reduce reliance on
                        fossil fuels. Moreover, advancements in technology have revolutionized egg
                        farming, with innovations like automated egg collection systems and precision
                        nutrition management tools improving efficiency and productivity while
                        reducing labor requirements. <br>
                        <b>V. Reading comprehension.</b> Answer the questions based on the passage.
                        1. How do egg farmers prioritize the welfare of hens within their production
                        facilities? <br>
                        2. What strategies do sustainable egg farms employ to minimize their
                        environmental impact? <br>
                        3. Can you provide examples of technological innovations that have revolutionized
                        efficiency in egg farming operations? <br>

                    frozen, liquid, and dried. They can be whole eggs, just the white, or just the
                    yolk. There are also special types of egg products. Eggs that have been
                    turned into other products:
                    Sauces and dressings like mayonnaise, hollandaise, and aioli.
                    Sweets like tiramisu, mousse, and fried ice cream.
                    Beverages like protein shakes made with raw eggs and egg nog.

                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    1.Modern egg farming operations prioritize the welfare of the hens,
                    providing ample space, proper nutrition, and access to clean water and
                    fresh air.
                    2. Sustainable egg farming practices also focus on environmental
                    stewardship. This includes efficient use of resources, such as water and
                    feed, as well as waste management strategies to minimize environmental
                    impact. Some egg farms utilize ren﻿ewable energy sources, such as solar
                    power, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.3. Moreover, advancements in technology have
                    revolutionized egg
                    farming, with innovations like automated egg collection systems and
