                        Nutritional acids, dyes, and flavorings play significant roles in the food
                        industry, affecting taste, appearance, and even shelf life. These additives are
                        commonly used in processed foods, beverages, and snacks to enhance their
                        sensory appeal and nutritional profile.
                        Nutritional acids, such as citric acid and acetic acid, are natural compounds
                        found in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. They are often used as
                        preservatives to inhibit bacterial growth, regulate acidity levels, and add
                        tanginess to foods. Citric acid, for instance, not only imparts a sour taste but
                        also helps preserve the vibrant color of fruits in canned form.
                        Dyes are synthetic or natural substances added to food to alter its color,
                        making it more visually appealing. Synthetic dyes like FD&C Red No. 40 and
                        Yellow No. 5 are widely used in candies, beverages, and processed snacks.
                        Natural dyes, derived from sources like beets and turmeric, are gaining
                        popularity as consumers seek cleaner label options.
                        Flavorings, both natural and artificial, are added to food to enhance or
                        mimic specific tastes and aromas. These can range from simple vanilla and
                        almond extracts to complex formulations designed to replicate the flavors of
                        fruits, spices, or savory ingredients.V. Reading comprehension. Answer the questions based on
                        the passage.

                            1.Certain amino acids, called isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
                            phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine, cannot be made by
                            mammals and must be obtained from food. These amino acids are essential
                            for good health. These are often called the important amino acids.
                            2. Flavors make food taste good but don't give any nutrients. There are
                            both natural and man-made flavors. We pick fake flavors on purpose to
                            give you lots of different tastes. Flavourings make food taste better and
                            more interesting.
                            New flavorings give people a better taste and smell experience and are
                            safer to use. They also make sure that the flavor is always the same.

                                Answer the questions based on the passage.
                            1 Nutritional acids, such as citric acid and acetic acid, are natural
                            compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. They are often
                            used as preservatives to inhibit bacterial growth, regulate acidity levels,
                            and add tanginess to foods. Citric acid, for instance, not only imparts a
                            sour taste but also helps preserve the vibrant color of fruits in canned
                            form.
                            2. Dyes are synthetic or natural substances added to food to alter its color,
                            making it more visually appealing. Synthetic dyes like FD&C Red No. 40
                            and Yellow No. 5 are widely used in candies, beverages, and processed
                            snacks. Natural dyes, derived from sources like beets and turmeric, are
                            gaining popularity as consumers seek cleaner label options.3. Flavorings, both natural and
                            artificial, are added to food to enhance or
                            mimic specific tastes and aromas. These can range from simple vanilla and
                            almond extracts to complex formulations designed to replicate the flavors
                            of fruits, spices, or savory ingredients.
                            While these additives can improve the sensory experience of food,
                            consumers should be mindful of their intake and opt for whole, minimally
                            processed options whenever possible to prioritize overall health and well-
                            being.
