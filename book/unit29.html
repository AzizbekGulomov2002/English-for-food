                        trade, offering business development services, and representing the interests of
                        the sector both domestically and internationally.
                        Furthermore, the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural
                        Mechanization Engineers and other agricultural universities play a significant
                        role in educating and training professionals in fields related to food production,
                        processing, and technology.V. Reading comprehension. Answer the questions based on the passage.
