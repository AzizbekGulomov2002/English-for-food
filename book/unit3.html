                        The Republic of Uzbekistan has a modern food industry that occupies an
                    important position in the national economy. This industry is mainly based on
                    the processing of local raw materials. The food industry accounts for 8.1% of
                    the country's total industrial output. The network includes meat-milk, fat-oil,
                    fish products, flour and cereals, bread, pasta, fruit and vegetable preserves,
                    packaging, grape and champagne wine, alcohol, vodka, tobacco, beer, thirst-
                    quenching drinks, soap and other industries. New modern technologies and
                    equipment are being installed in enterprises. Measures are being taken to meet
                    the needs of the population with food products produced in the country itself.
                    Because the contribution of food products in the export is the largest.
                    One of the leading sectors of the republic's food industry is oil production.
                    Since ancient times vegetable oil, sesame, flax, cottonseed, and linseed have
                    been obtained from seeds. This food industry accounts for 25% of the total
                    production volume. The first cotton seed oil factory in Uzbekistan was built in
                    1884 in Kokan. Currently, there are large oil extraction factories in Kasansay,
                    Gulistan, Ferghana, Kokan, Kattakorghan, Denov and other cities.

                    Phrasal verbs in English language have significant and varied use. They are the

                    and eating food. Read them aloud and find their Uzbek translation from
                    dictionary. <br>
