                        Global food industry institutions play pivotal roles in ensuring food
                        security, safety, and sustainability worldwide. Among these institutions, the
                        Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stands out as a leading entity
                        within the United Nations system, working to eliminate hunger and
                        improve nutrition. Through research, policy development, and technical
                        assistance, the FAO addresses issues such as food production, distribution,
                        and agricultural development on a global scale.Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO)
                        plays a crucial role
                        in safeguarding public health related to food consumption. It sets
                        international standards and guidelines for food safety and nutrition,
                        collaborating with governments and other stakeholders to promote healthy
                        diets and prevent foodborne illnesses.
                        On the trade front, the World Trade Organization (WTO) oversees
                        international trade agreements and negotiations concerning agricultural
                        products and food commodities. It aims to facilitate fair and transparent
                        trade practices while addressing trade barriers and disputes that may affect
                        the global food supply chain.
                        international food organizations
                        Furthermore, organizations like the Codex Alimentarius Commission
                        establish standards and guidelines for food safety and quality, providing a
                        framework for international trade and consumer protection. <br>
