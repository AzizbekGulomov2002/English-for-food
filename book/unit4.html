                        IV. Reading task. 
                    </b> Read the passage for overall understanding. <br>
                    Microbiology means “micro”-small - “bio”-life. It deals with the
                    relationship of microorganisms with the external environment and its
                    development. Food microbiology studies microorganisms in food products,
                    their safety and quality. It includes the identification, isolation, and
                    characterization of microorganisms in foods, as well as the study of their
                    growth, metabolism, and interactions with food and the environment.
                    Food products consumed by humans can be of animal and vegetable origin.
                    In this regard, it becomes possible to predict the general types of
                    microorganisms that can multiply in them. During the processing and storage
                    of plant and animal raw materials, there is an increase or decrease in the
                    number of microorganisms originally present in it. Any vital activity of
                    microorganisms in food raw materials and products of its processing leads to
                    a change in their chemical and physical composition. If the multiplying
                    microorganisms cause the degradation of nutrients, then microbial metabolism
                    is called spoilage.
                    Particular attention should be paid to microorganisms that cause foodborne
                    infections and poisoning. If sanitary and hygienic requirements are violated,
                    they can multiply in most products and accumulate toxic metabolic products.
                    The rate of reproduction of microorganisms in food products is influenced by
                    the structure and consistency, chemical composition, water activity and pH
                    values, the presence of antimicrobial substances, the composition of the gas
                    environment, humidity, temperature, technological parameters, etc. <br>

                    Countable and uncountable nouns.
                    In English grammar, countable nouns are individual people, animals, places,
                    things, or ideas which can be counted. Uncountable nouns are not individual
                    objects, so they cannot be counted <br>
                    We cannot count some nouns (uncountable nouns). They do not have a plural
                    form and take a singular verb, even if they end in -s.
                    Some uncountable nouns:
                    Example:
                    bread, fruit, rice, water,Do not keep bread for a long time.
                    salt, cereal, flour, juice,Bags of flour are transported to the shop.
                    meat, cheese
                    Water is vital to survive in desert.
                    Countable nouns have a singular and a plural form and take a singular or
                    plural verb.
                    Countable nounsExample
                    Apple/applesThere were 20 apples on the market stall.
                    Cherry / cherriesThese cherries are rotten and can`t be eaten.
                    Tomato / tomatoesThe tomatoes I bought the day before are spoiled now.
                    food microbiology
                    A few countable nouns have irregular plurals. They include:
                    One child - two childrenOne person – two people
                    One foot – two feet / One tooth, two teeth
                    One man – two men / One woman – two  women <br>

                    Divide the students into 4 groups and ask them to write 2 sentences about a
                    photo you have hung on the whiteboard in advance. Give them two minutes to
                    complete sentences and hand in their sheets to the group on their right. Group
                    members are asked to continue the partner groups sentences in next 2 minutes.
                    Sheets cycle until the groups get their original ones. The winner is the one who
                    could write the most interesting story with topic related vocabulary. <br>

                    I. Pre reading task.</b>   <br>
                    1. There are mainly three types of causes of food spoilage viz. biological,
                    chemical and physical causes. Biological causes comprise of growth and activity
                    of microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast and molds; activity of food enzymes
                    and damage due to pests, insects and rodents etc.
                    2. 2. There are many factors which can be the reasons for food unsuitable for
                    consuming. Light, oxygen, heat, humidity, temperature and spoilage bacteria
                    can all affect both safety and quality of perishable foods. When subject to these
                    factors, foods will gradually deteriorate. <br> <br>

                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    <br>1. Food microbiology studies microorganisms in food products, their safety and
                    quality. It includes the identification, isolation, and characterization of
                    microorganisms in foods, as well as the study of their growth, metabolism, and
                    interactions with food and the environment.
                    <br>2. During the processing and storage of plant and animal raw materials, there is
                    an increase or decrease in the number of microorganisms originally present in
                    it. Any vital activity of microorganisms in food raw materials and products of
                    its processing leads to a change in their chemical and physical composition. If
                    the multiplying microorganisms cause the degradation of nutrients, then
                    microbial metabolism is called spoilage.
                    <br>3. The rate of reproduction of microorganisms in food products is influenced by
                    the structure and consistency, chemical composition, water activity and pH
                    values, the presence of antimicrobial substances, the composition of the gas
                    environment, humidity, temperature, technological parameters, etc.
                    <br>4. If sanitary and hygienic requirements are violated, they can multiply in most
                    products and accumulate toxic metabolic products. <br>
