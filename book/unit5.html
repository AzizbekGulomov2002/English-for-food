                <br>According to scientific data, there are approximately 100 trillion cells in the
                human body, and 90 trillion of them, that is, 9 out of 10, are bacteria of
                various forms. These tiny organisms are bacteria, viruses, yeasts and protozoa.
                <br>Bacteria are unicellular organisms that contain the most important
                components for survival and reproduction - chromosome, ribosome, cytoplasm
                and outer membrane.
                Bacteria are one of the most important microorganisms for food processing.
                Most of them are harmless and even useful, and some indicate the presence of
                disease in the body. Although there are thousands of species of bacteria, they
                are all single-celled and come in three basic shapes: spherical, straight rods,
                and spiral rods. Some common foodborne bacteria mainly affect children, the
                bacteria
                elderly and immunocompromised people.
                <br> Lactobacillus species are an important component of human and animal
                microbiota and improve the functioning of a number of our organs, including
                the digestive system. They are one of the most common probiotics found in
                food products such as yogurt. The spherical bacterium staphylococcus is found
                mainly in water, in air droplets, in the normal microflora of humans and
                animals and causes disease. Poisoning (toxic infection) is observed when eating
                milk and dairy products, cake, ice cream and other food products containing
                pathogenic staphylococcus.

                    1. Bacteria are extremely vital for both human body to function and food to
                    grow and to be edible. Although most of these tiny organisms are useful some
                    might cause disease in humans. There are thousands of species of bacteria but
                    they are all single-celled and come in three basic shapes: spherical, straight
                    rods, and spiral rods. Bacteria contain the most important components for
                    survival and reproduction - chromosome, ribosome, cytoplasm and outer
                    membrane.
                    <br> 2. Most bacteria which are in our gut, get nutrients from us and also aid to
                    digest food and protect the body from ‘bad bacteria’. They are called
                    symbiotic,
                    or
                    ‘good
                    bacteria’.
                    In
                    food,
                    probiotics
                    (Lactobacillus,
                    Bifidobacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii) found
                    in digestive, urinary and genital systems. Bad bacteria damage our health.
                    They are called as pathogens. The bacterium causing cholera, Vibrio
                    cholerae, can be acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated
                    bacteria
                    with the infected people or through direct contact with an infected person.
                    Streptococcus, which can cause sore throats, is caught through contact with
                    infected saliva, such as through coughing.

                    Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have shown that the
                    bacteria found on our skin can be used to identify people. The bacteria on
                    your hands are unique to you. Even identical twins have their own unique
                    bacteria on their skin. When we touch something, we leave some of our
                    bacteria on the object. Through bacterial DNA analysis, specific bacteria on
                    surfaces can be matched to the hands of the person who left them. Because
                    bacteria are unique and remain unchanged for several weeks, they can be
                    used as an alternative to fingerprints.
