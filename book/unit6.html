                    </b> Certain types of fungi exist as single cells, while others are composed
                    of multiple cells. Yeast is the term used for single-celled fungi. Some
                    fungi have the ability to transition between single-celled yeast and
                    multicellular structures, depending on their life cycle stage. Fungal
                    cells, akin to those of plants and animals, contain a nucleus and
                    organelles. Unlike plant cells, the cell walls of fungi are made of chitin,
                    a sturdy substance also present in the exoskeletons of insects and
                    arthropods.
                    Multicellular fungi consist of numerous branching filaments called
                    hyphae (singular: hypha). These hyphae possess a tubular shape and
                    are divided into cell-like sections by septa walls. These compartments
                    may contain more than one nucleus, with organelles capable of moving
                    between them. Though commonly referred to as multicellular, there's a
                    debate regarding whether they truly fit this classification, as organelles
                    and cytoplasm can move between cells in a process known as
                    cytoplasmic streaming. Despite this, they are commonly regarded as
                    multicellular, although not in the same manner as plants and animals,
                    which possess enclosed cells. The interconnected network of hyphae
                    within a fungus is termed a mycelium.
                    Fungi, as heterotrophs, rely on organic material for nutrients,
                    utilizing their hyphae to rapidly expand their mycelium. Some fungi
                    develop rhizomorphs to anchor themselves to substrates and enhance
                    nutrient absorption. They are opportunistic, thriving in diverse
                    environments and obtaining sustenance from various sources. Some
                    fungi decompose dead matter as saprobes, while others cause plant
                    diseases like Dutch elm disease. Fungi also form symbiotic
                    relationships, such as lichens with algae and mycorrhizae with plant
                    roots, showcasing their ecological versatility.

                        VI. Grammar.
                        Much / Many
                        In English grammar, "much" and "many" are both quantifiers used to
                        indicate quantity, but they are used in different contexts.
                        "Much" is primarily used with uncountable nouns to indicate a large
                        amount or degree. It is often used with abstract nouns or substances
                        that cannot be easily counted.
                        fungi
                        Example:
                        There isn't much time left before the train departs. (Time is an
                        uncountable noun.)
                        She doesn't have much patience when it comes to waiting in lines.
                        (Patience is an abstract noun.)
                        "Many," on the other hand, is used with countable nouns to indicate a
                        large number or quantity. It is typically used when you can easily count
                        the items or objects.
                        Example:
                        There are many books on the shelf. (Books can be counted.)
                        How many students are in your class? (Students can be counted.)
                        In summary, use "much" with uncountable nouns and "many" with
                        countable nouns to convey quantity in English sentences. <br>

                        Ask students to come to take cards turned back and sit according to “much and
                        many” cards. Then write several sentences with gaps to fill out with quantifiers.
                        Students are asked to attach the appropriate quantifier in the gaps. At the end of
                        the activity motivate them to make their own sentences for the quantifier they
                        have taken. <br>

                    All fungi utilize spores for reproduction. Spores, which are tiny cells or
                    clusters of cells, disperse from the ______ fungus, often by wind or
                    water. They may remain dormant until favorable conditions for
                    growth arise, serving as an adaptation for opportunistic ______ of new

                    I Pre reading task. <br>
                    1. What do you know about fungus and it’s significance ?
                    Fungi are an important part of the variety of living things in soil. This
                    group of organisms can help with big worldwide problems like climate
                    change and hunger. Fungi are closely connected to plants and help with
                    the movement of carbon and nutrients in the environment.
                    2. Explain the types of fungi that you know.
                    There are different types of fungi, like molds, mushrooms, rusts, smuts,
                    mildews, and yeast. There are three main types of fungi: mushrooms,
                    molds, and yeasts.

                    Answer the questions based on the passage. <br>
                    1.What is the primary method by which fungi obtain nutrients?
                    Fungi cannot make their own food. They need to get their food from other
                    sources. They eat by taking in nutrients from their surroundings. Fungi
                    and bacteria in soil break down plant and animal materials in the
                    environment.
                    2.Can you name one example of a fungal disease that affects plants? For
                    instance, mycorrhizae work together with plant roots to help each other.
                    Conversely, harmful fungi make plants sick with diseases like anthracnose,
                    leaf spot, rust, wilt, blight, coils, scab, gall, canker, damping-off, root rot,
                    mildew, and dieback.
                    3. What are two types of symbiotic relationships involving fungi
                    mentioned in the text?
                    Fungi also form symbiotic relationships, such as lichens with algae and
                    mycorrhizae with plant roots, showcasing their ecological versatility. <br>

                    The majority of fungi possess the capability for both sexual and
                    asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction occurs either through the
                    dispersal of spores or through mycelial fragmentation, where the
                    mycelium breaks into multiple pieces that grow independently. In
                    sexual reproduction, separate fungal entities merge their hyphae. The
                    specific life cycle varies among species, but typically multicellular fungi
                    progress through haploid, diploid, and dikaryotic stages, the latter
                    featuring two sets of chromosomes that remain distinct.
                    All fungi utilize spores for reproduction. Spores, which are tiny cells
                    or clusters of cells, disperse from the parent fungus, often by wind or
                    water. They may remain dormant until favorable conditions for
                    growth arise, serving as an adaptation for opportunistic colonization
                    of new resources amidst unpredictable food availability. Fungi
                    generate spores through both sexual and asexual reproductive
                    processes.
