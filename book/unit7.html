                        Read the passage for overall understanding paying attention to the bolded words. <br>
                        In today's fast-paced world, where convenience often trumps tradition, the
                        preservation of food has become an indispensable practice. From extending
                        shelf life to ensuring food safety, various methods and additives play a crucial
                        role in keeping our meals fresh and flavorsome. Let's delve into some of these
                        techniques and their implications for health and sustainability.
                        Chemical additives, such as potassium sorbate and acetic acid, are commonly
                        used to inhibit microbial growth and maintain the quality of packaged foods.
                        While effective, concerns about their long-term health effects have led to a
                        growing interest in natural alternatives. Natural preservatives, derived from
                        plants and herbs, offer a promising solution, providing both preservation and
                        food preservatives peace of mind. <br>
                        One such method is fermentation, a time-honored practice that harnesses
                        the power of beneficial microorganisms to transform food. From kimchi to
                        kombucha, fermented foods not only boast extended shelf life but also offer
                        probiotic benefits for gut health. This ancient preservation technique continues
                        to thrive in modern kitchens, marrying tradition with innovation.
                        Meanwhile, freezing remains a staple in every household, preserving fruits,
                        vegetables, and meats alike. By lowering temperatures to sub-zero levels,
                        freezing halts microbial activity and maintains the nutritional integrity of
                        foods. Vacuum packaging further enhances preservation by creating an
                        oxygen-free environment, reducing the risk of spoilage and food waste.
                        Dehydration, another age-old method, removes moisture from foods,
                        preventing bacterial growth and preserving nutrients. Whether through sun-
                        drying or modern dehydration technologies, this technique transforms
                        perishable produce into long-lasting snacks and ingredients, perfect for on-
                        the-go lifestyles. <br>
                        As we navigate towards a more health-conscious and environmentally-
                        friendly future, the preservation of food stands at the intersection of
                        innovation and tradition. By embracing modern methods alongside natural
                        alternatives, we can ensure the longevity of our food supply while preserving
                        our planet for generations to come.
                        <br><b>V. Reading comprehension.</b> Read the following statements and decide if they are
                        true (T), false (F), or if the information is not given (NG) based on the text.
                        <br>1. Chemical additives, such as potassium sorbate and acetic acid, are the
                        only methods mentioned for preserving food.
                        <br>2. Fermentation is a preservation technique that solely relies on harmful
                        microorganisms.
                        <br>3. Vacuum packaging creates an oxygen-free environment, reducing the
                        likelihood of spoilage.
                        <br>4. Dehydration removes moisture from foods, preventing bacterial growth
                        and preserving nutrients.
                        <br>5. The text mentions that concerns about the health effects of chemical
                        additives have led to a decreased interest in natural alternatives.
                        <br>6. Freezing foods is not effective in maintaining their nutritional value.
                        <br>7. The text suggests that fermentation is only practiced in traditional
                        kitchens and has no relevance in modern cooking.
                        <br>8. The primary focus of the text is on promoting the use of chemical
                        additives over natural preservation methods.
                        <br>9. Natural preservatives are derived solely from synthetic sources.
                        <br>10. The text implies that modern preservation methods are incompatible with
                        sustainable practices. <br>
                        <b>VI. Grammar.</b> Present Perfect
                        Formation: The present perfect tense is formed using the auxiliary verb "have"
                        (in its different forms: have/has) followed by the past participle of the main
                        verb.
                        Example: <br>
                        I have eaten.
                        She has finished her homework. <br>
                        Subject-Verb Agreement: The choice of "have" or "has" depends on the subject
                        of the sentence: <br>
                        "Have" is used with pronouns I, you, we, they, and with plural nouns.
                        "Has" is used with pronouns he, she, it, and with singular nouns.
                        Examples: <br>
                        We have traveled to many countries.
                        She has visited Paris. <br>
                        Actions in the Past with Relevance to the Present: The present perfect tense is
                        used to express actions that started in the past and continue into the present or
                        have just been completed, emphasizing the connection between the past and
                        the present.
                        Examples:
                        I have lived in this city for five years. (I still live here.)
                        They have just finished their meal. (The action of finishing the meal is
                        recent.)
                        Unspecified Time Frame: The present perfect tense is used to talk about
                        experiences or actions in life without specifying when they occurred.
                        Examples: <br>
                        She has read "War and Peace." (At some point in her life.)
                        Have you ever traveled abroad? (At any time in the past.)
                        Use of "Yet" and "Already": "Yet" is used in negative sentences and questions
                        to indicate an action that is expected to happen or be completed at some
                        point. "Already" is used in positive sentences to indicate that an action has
                        been completed before the present moment. <br>
                        Examples:
                        They haven't arrived yet. (Expected to arrive.)
                        Have you already finished your work? (Completed before now.)
                        Signal Words: Signal words such as "just," "recently," "ever," "never,"
                        "already," "yet," "for," and "since" often accompany the present perfect tense,
                        providing context for the timing or duration of the action.
                        Examples: <br>
