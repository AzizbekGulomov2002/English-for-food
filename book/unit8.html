                    <p>
                        Chemistry in food science is the study of properties, composition and
                        chemical change which take place in processing and storage. It is interrelated
                        with other subjects like chemistry, molecular biology, botany, zoology and
                        other biology chemical sciences. Food chemists deal with biological matters of
                        dead or dying that are post harvest physiology of plants and changes in
                        different environmental conditions. That is why a food chemistry is responsible
                        for conditions suitable for sustaining the residual life processes (post harvest
                        physiology) for example fresh fruits and vegetables during their marketing.
                        Ensuring nutritious and safe food products is also one of the concerns of
                        the science and thanks to it consumers can be aware of information on food
                        food chemistry
                        they are purchasing. Nutrition studies reveal that the human body needs
                        certain nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats in large quantities and
                        some others like vitamins and minerals in much smaller quantities.
                        Today, sensory qualities or external qualities of food including color,
                        appearance, firmness, mouth feel, flavor, taste can be controlled through
                        chemical reaction. Changes in these qualities, for example in fruits affects the
                        value reducing in the market. For example, loss of the green color of spinach
                        on storage or cooking is due to degradation of chlorophyll. Similarly, browning
                        of cut apples is initiated due to enzymatic oxidation of phenolic substances.
                        Softening of fruits for example is due to the breakdown of pectins or
                        toughening of meat is due to post mortem chemical changes resulting in pH
                        reduction and tissue hardening.
                        Changes in flavor is also because of chemical reactions. For example, flavor
                        change in fatty foods called rancidity is due to oxidation of unsaturated fatty
                        acids. Consumers know about these in subsequent units. What is important is
                        that once you know the chemical cause of quality deterioration, it is possible to
                        devise methods to control it. <br>

                        <br>4. What other examples do you know about chemical reactions affecting

                    <b>I. Pre reading task.</b>
                    1. Chemistry in food science is the study of properties, composition and
                    chemical change which take place in processing and storage. It is interrelated
                    with other subjects like chemistry, molecular biology, botany, zoology and
                    other biology chemical sciences. Food chemists deal with biological matters of
                    dead or dying that are post harvest physiology of plants and changes in
                    different environmental conditions. That is why a food chemistry is
                    responsible for conditions suitable for sustaining the residual life processes
                    (post harvest physiology) for example fresh fruits and vegetables during their
                    marketing.
                    2. Today, sensory qualities or external qualities of food including color,
                    appearance, firmness, mouth feel, flavor, taste can be controlled through

                    chemical reaction. Changes in these qualities, for example in fruits affects the
                    value reducing in the market. For example, loss of the green color of spinach
                    on storage or cooking is due to degradation of chlorophyll. Similarly,
                    browning of cut apples is initiated due to enzymatic oxidation of phenolic
                    substances. Softening of fruits for example is due to the breakdown of pectins
                    or toughening of meat is due to post mortem chemical changes resulting in pH
                    reduction and tissue hardening. <br>

                    Answer the questions based on the passage.
                    <br>1. Food chemists deal with biological matters of dead or dying that are post
                    harvest physiology of plants and changes in different environmental
                    conditions. That is why a food chemistry is responsible for conditions suitable
                    for sustaining the residual life processes (post harvest physiology) for example
                    fresh fruits and vegetables during their marketing. <br>
                    <br>2. Nutrition studies reveal that the human body needs certain nutrients like
                    carbohydrates, proteins and fats in large quantities and some others like
                    vitamins and minerals in much smaller quantities.
                    <br>3. Changes in flavor is also because of chemical reactions. For example, flavor
                    change in fatty foods called rancidity is due to oxidation of unsaturated fatty
                    acids. Consumers know about these in subsequent units.
                    <br>4. Give example of chemical change reactions affecting flavor from your own
                    knowledge. <br>
