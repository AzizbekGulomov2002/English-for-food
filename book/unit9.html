                    <b>IV. Reading task.</b> Read the passage for overall understanding paying attention
                    to the bolded words.
                    <p>
                        Virtually all foods are derived from living cells from animals and plant
                        origin and in some cases from some microorganisms by biotechnology methods.
                        Thus, foods are for the most part composed of “edible biochemicals”. One of
                        the most important goals of the food scientist is to make foods as safe as
                        possible whet her they are used fresh or processed. The judicious application of
                        food processing, storage and preservation methods helps prevent outbreaks of
                        foodborne illness, that is the occurrence of disease or illness resulting from the
                        consumption of contaminated food. The processed food industry has an
                        outstanding record preventing such cases when it is considered that billions of
                        cans, jars, packets and pouches of processed and fresh food products are
                        consumed annually. Occasionally, however, this excellent record has been
                        broken by limited outbreaks in which persons do succumb to the effects of
                        toxic foods. Food preservation is an action or method of designed to maintain
                        foods at a desired level of quality. A number of new preservation techniques are
                        being developed to satisfy current demands of economic preservation and
                        food safety
                        consumer satisfaction in safety, nutritional and sensory aspects.
                        Major processes of food deterioration are caused by environmental factors
                        such as temperature, humidity, oxygen and light which can be reason for
                        several reaction mechanisms that may lead to food deterioration to such an
                        extent that they are either rejected by or harmful to the consumer. Microbial
                        effects are the leading cause of food deterioration and spoilage.
                        Governments around the world recognize that a safe food supply is one of
                        the foundations of public health and is also essential for food and nutrition
                        security. Furthermore, the safety of foods traded needs to be assured in order
                        to attain and maintain international and regional markets, thus improving
                        economic development.
                        Food safety takes place at many levels within a network of manufacturers,
                        inspectors, scientific assessments in laboratories and official risk management.
                        Whether an industrial enterprise, a farmer, a baker, a butcher or a
                        restaurateur: those involved in food production are responsible for ensuring
                        the food has the proper composition, characteristics and labelling. Food
                        inspectors, official veterinarians and food chemists in cities and districts inspect
                        in-house controls, correct labelling, the hygiene of rooms, working tools and staff and much
                        else besides. They also take food samples, five samples per 1
                        000 inhabitants each year to be precise, which are then tested in laboratories
                        for contaminants, residues and disease-carrying organisms.
                        Foods are perishable or deteriorative by nature. Based on the mode of
                        action, major food preservation techniques can be categorised as: slowing
                        down or inhibiting chemical deterioration and microbial growth; directly
                        inactivating bacteria, yeast, moulds and enzymes and avoiding
                        recontamination before and after processing. <br>
                        <b>V. Reading comprehension.</b> Answer the questions based on the passage.
                        <br>1. What does the food safety deal with?
                        <br>2. Why is it so important?
                        <br>3. What are the food preservation techniques?<br>
                        VI. Grammar. Reported speech. Study this example situation:<br>

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img style="height: 290px; width: 300px;" src="images/image30.png" alt="">
                    </div> <br>



                    When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past
                    (Asror said that … / He told her that … etc.). The rest of the sentence is
                    usually past too:
                    Asror said that he was feeling good.
                    I told Munisa that I didn’t have any money.
                    You can leave out that. So you can say:
                    Asror said that he was feeling ill. or Asror said he was feeling ill. <br>
                    In general, the present in direct speech changes to the past in reported speech:
                    am/is → was do/does → did will → would
                    are → were have/has → had can → could
                    want/like/know/go etc. → wanted/liked/knew/went etc.
                    Compare direct and reported speech: <br> <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img style="height: 290px; width: 300px;" src="images/image31.png" alt="">
                    </div> <br>
                    The past simple (did/saw/knew etc.) can stay the same in reported speech, or
                    you can change it to the past perfect (had done / had seen / had known etc.):
                    direct: Asror said: “I woke up feeling ill, so I didn’t go to work.”
                    reported: <br>
                    Asror said (that) he woke up feeling ill, so he didn’t go to work. OR
                    Asror said (that) he had woken up feeling ill, so he hadn’t gone to
                    work. <br>
                    Exercise 1. Fill in the gaps with reported speech. <br>
                    1. The food specialist asked students ______if they understood the topic.
                    <br>2. Our gardener said that he ______ come to the office twice.
                    <br>3. Students said that she ____ studying very hard at that moment to pass
                    exams.
                    <br>4. Nargiza asked me where I ______bought the dictionary.
                    <br>5. I was informed that the food chemist ____ an experiment to test the
                    pepper`s nutrition.<br>
                    6. My friend said they _____the best books she had ever seen.
                    <br>7. Tolib said it ___a great experience.
                    <br>8. Students ___told that they must not touch the experimental tubes under any
                    circumstances. <br>
                    <b>VIII. Classroom activity.</b> “Tick or Cross” method. <br>
                    Prepare 10 cards with sentences for reported speech. Ask two students to come
                    to the blackboard and read one sentence aloud. They should decide if the
                    sentences on the cards are true or false in turn. Put cross mark for false and tick
                    food safety for true sentences. Winner is the one who answers correctly. <br>

                    cream. Wait for 2 minutes and check the color of the sour cream. If it darkens it
                    means there is some amount of starch in sour cream. If the mixture doesn’t
                    change the color, it means there is no starch and sour cream is safe to eat! <br>

                    1. Virtually all foods are derived from living cells from animals and plant
                    origin and in some cases from some microorganisms by biotechnology
                    methods. Thus, foods are for the most part composed of “edible
                    biochemicals”. One of the most important goals of the food scientist is to
                    make foods as safe as possible whet her they are used fresh or processed.
                    <br>2. A number of new preservation techniques are being developed to satisfy
                    current demands of economic preservation and consumer satisfaction in
                    safety, nutritional and sensory aspects. <br>
                    Major processes of food deterioration are caused by environmental factors
                    such as temperature, humidity, oxygen and light which can be reason for
                    several reaction mechanisms that may lead to food deterioration to such an
                    extent that they are either rejected by or harmful to the consumer. Microbial
                    effects are the leading cause of food deterioration and spoilage. <br>
                    3. Foods are perishable or deteriorative by nature. Based on the mode of
                    action, major food preservation techniques can be categorized as: slowing
                    down or inhibiting chemical deterioration and microbial growth; directly
                    inactivating bacteria, yeast, molds and enzymes and avoiding recontamination
                    before and after processing.  <br>
